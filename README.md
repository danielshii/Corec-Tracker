<h3 align="center">Corec Tracker</h3>
  <p align="center">
    Here at Purdue University, students are going to the Corec every day to get their daily workouts in. Because of this, the Corec is consistently brimming with students. With more people surrounding you as you work out, it is understandable that your workout may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as you might want it to be. For example, you might have to wait for your favorite gym machine to be available, and that takes precious time away from your workout. This web-based project aims to make planning your workouts easier by utilizing Computer Vision and security camera footage, along with a person counting algorithm, to track how occupied different areas of the Corec are so that you can see how busy your favorite workout areas at any time, from any location. In this way, it will be much easier for you to select which days are best for working out.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    Although this project hasn't been pushed to development yet, the code is all complete. All there is left to do is pitch this project to the employees at the Corec and gain their approval. Once that happens, this project will be available for everyone to use!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On the graph page, users can see the live occupancies of every room, along with how occupancies of the Corec's rooms change over time. Additionally, users can see the averages, standard deviations, and other occupancy details.

Users can also create accounts if they wish to subscribe to notifications. Through the settings page, users can freely customize their notification preferences. For example, users can opt to receive notifications when the occupancy of a particular room drops below a certain value.
